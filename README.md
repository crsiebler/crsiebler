## ⚡ What Drives Me

I’m a developer passionate about leveraging and building the next generation of AI agents and tools. I use LLM-powered agents (OpenAI, OpenCode) in daily workflows and actively explore autonomous agent frameworks (especially Agent Zero). I’m continuously improving my prompt engineering skills and exploring developer-augmenting AI patterns. I am currently learning ML model training and instruction-tuned LLMs, and am diving deep into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## 🛠️ AI & Dev Tooling

- **LLM Agents & Agents**: OpenAI API, OpenCode (for AI-powered development), Agent Zero (autonomous AI Agents), experimenting with Ralph-style agent loops
- **Core Stack**: TypeScript, Python, React.js, Next.js, Vue.js
- **DevOps/MLOps**: Docker, AWS, GitHub Actions, Playwright CI
- **Focus**: Architectural clarity, high developer efficiency, automating routine tasks with AI agents
- **AI Philosophy**: My approach is "AI-augmented by default"—I use AI agents not just to code, but to orchestrate architectures, draft PRDs, and solve problems creatively.
